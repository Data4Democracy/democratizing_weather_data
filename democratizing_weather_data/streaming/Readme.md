This streaming folder was created by a team of University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education night school students for a final project, for class Big Data 230B Emerging Technologies in Big Data 8/23/2017.

The main components of the project are:
- A set of python scripts that use Apache Kafka and Web API's to gather weather and traffic data from Washington State Dept of Transportation (WSDOT) and Yahoo Query Language (YQL), and save to disk as json files.
- A Jupyter Notebook that aggregates the JSON files into data frames, and does some mapping and graphing.

| Folder | description |
|-----:|-------------|
| APIs | sample json files from various weather & traffic API's.  Also contains csv with API calling syntax|
|sample_code| Ignore this.  It was used in early develpment then abandoned |
|prototypes| Jupyter Notebooks|


Cool-looking table, huh?  I learned how to do it from [adam-p's markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


Future Work
- Create a sandbox repo, and move a bunch of files there.
- Finalize comprehensive data frames, export to csv, upload to data.world.
- Assemble a data dictionary
