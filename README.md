# Democratizing Weather Data

This Python package is designed to make the QCLCD surface weather
station data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) more accessible to data science audiences and the general public.
Weather data contains a wealth of information gathered from Earth Observing
systems and can be used to gather a wide variety of valuable insights from
multiple industries. However the data is sometimes in formats that are not
suitable for machine or human consumption. This package helps to break down
this barrier for this specific dataset.
